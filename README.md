## Notes

While building the app, I encountered a few challenges related to working with React hooks and event handling. Understanding how to properly use the useState() hook to manage state variables within functional components was initially challenging, especially when dealing with complex state structures.

Additionally, passing data through props between parent and child components required careful consideration of component hierarchy and data flow. Ensuring that the correct data was being passed and accessed at each level of the component tree was crucial for the app's functionality.

Implementing event handling, particularly for button clicks, required me to grasp the concept of handling events in React and attaching event listeners to components. This involved learning about event propagation and handling events efficiently to trigger the desired actions within the app.

Overall, while these challenges presented a learning curve, overcoming them provided valuable insights into React's core concepts and improved my understanding of building interactive applications with React.
